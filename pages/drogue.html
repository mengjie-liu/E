        <p class="text">
          In the aftermath of the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, philosopher
          Jean-Luc Nancy declared that any disaster henceforth could no longer
          be dispensed as “a misfortune whose consequences can be more or less
          easily circumscribed.” Not when our technological, economical, and
          political structures are necessarily imbricated; and especially not
          when we are responsible for helming such “interdependent totality of
          civilization,” as we march towards the end of time in blissful
          precarity. So much for our hopes for salvation, Nancy’s enjoinder is a
          bleak dagger: “Let us think that it is we who are arriving, or who are
          leaving.”
          <br />&emsp;&emsp;To encounter Erik Nilson’s Drogue (2022) is to come
          to terms with Nancy’s dictum—to acknowledge and experience, once and
          for all, the end of our time. Sourced from Nilson’s jaunts in what he
          calls “interstitial” spaces—sites of industrial waste, reckless
          abandonment, and blurred landscape—the work in front of us denies any
          easy attempt at categorization or recognition. A capsized body of the
          boat covered in sea green sprawls on the floor, with a gaping hole in
          the shape of crankshaft. At its rear, a drift log gloriously sprouts
          out—the boat’s hard, metal shank morphing into the wood grain so
          spontaneously as if to declare that such a growth was a given. This
          permutation is continual: on the upper end of the drift log, smaller
          rusted steel sticks protrude outwards, while on the bottom corner,
          similar brown-encrusted hose lines extend. At the end: an anchor with
          a crankshaft in the center, replete with cracked red on its contours,
          as if it could awaken any moment to a motorized self and tear through
          any obstacles. If the bloodened anchor serves as an omen, forms morph
          and mutate endlessly on their own, traversing the multiple terrains.
          Decoupled from us, the decay has become newly reignited with life,
          creating its own reality. Unbeknownst to us, perhaps it has always
          been this way. <br />&emsp;&emsp;Accompanying the commanding boat-log
          hybrid are three sets of mechanical parts—stretched taut on the wall
          and the floor—and whose skeletal grooves taken on the sheen of
          fossilized bones. The found hardware, such as a found car part or a
          fan blade, seamlessly interlock with cast aluminum spirals. With these
          “stinger types,” as Nilson affectionately calls them, Nilson’s
          self-description as a fabricator comes to the fore. For the word
          fabricator not only speaks to the requisite labor in fashioning them,
          but also the forging—creating an entity that deviates from our
          conceptualization of the world. These uncanny stingers stretch and
          curl on their own accord, telegraphing a sense of deep vibrancy. And
          these otherworldly beings are staunch in their refusal to let their
          forces and energies be tapped and exploited by us.
          <br />&emsp;&emsp;The hollow mingles with the solid—the present
          shifting into an impression of something it once was. Strewn before us
          are the literal motors of our mundane lives, simultaneously present
          and absent. Drogue is the relic of our present, intertwined with a
          profound melancholy: we are the ones leaving.<br /><br />
